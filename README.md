# AnsOpDemo
This repo contains 2 Ansible operators (as of 6/18/19). One for memcache, written by Dylan Murray, and another for Mcrouter, written by Anshul Behl and John Lieske.

These operators were created using the [Operator-SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and are intended for PoC/small scale demos in their current form. If you want to learn more about Ansible Operators, check out these links for more information.
