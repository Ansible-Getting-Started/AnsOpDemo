# AnsOpDemo

This repo contains the Mcrouter Ansible Operator. Mcrouter uses memcache as backend and the operator written for memcache deployment by Dylan Murray [@dymurray](https://github.com/dymurray) helped as a reference for this.
This operator was created using the [Operator-SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and is intended for PoC/small scale demos in their current form.

# Instructions to Run

#### Requirements
- minikube
- kubectl
- operator-sdk
#### Connect to minikube docker environment
```sh
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
####  Create the custom resource definition for mcrouter
```sh
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/mcrouter_v1alpha2_mcrouter_crd.yaml
```
#### Build the mcrouter-operator docker image
```sh
operator-sdk build mcrouter-operator:v0.0.1
```
#### Create service account, role and role_bindings
```sh
kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
```
#### Deploy the Operator
```sh
kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml
```
#### Create the custom resources for mcrouter
You can change the pods to be deployed inside the files
```sh
kubectl create -f deploy/crds/mcrouter_v1alpha2_mcrouter_cr.yaml
```

> Once everything is deployed you can use the `kubectl get all` command
> to check of mcrouter-operator and memcache and deployed mcrouter are working

#### Use the below testing scenario to check if mcrouter and memcached are working as expected
Connect to mcrouter using the telnet container and send the following commands to see if you get expected output
```sh
kubectl run -it --rm telnet --image=jess/telnet --restart=Never <mcrouter_pod_ip> 5000
```
In the telnet prompt send below commands
```
    set mykey 0 0 5
    hello
    get mykey
    quit
```
Connect to memcached service using the telnet container and send the `stats` command to see if it gives you output.
